# Overview
I wrote a simple platforming game using the Unity game engine. 
To play this game you use the WASD keys to move the player. To jump you press the space bar.

I chose to write this software to learn the Unity game engine. I enjoy playing and making games and I thought it would be a super fun hobby with some friends to make video games.
